# AIS_Transfer_Learning
This is the source code for the candidate paper "Adaptive Calibration of Soft Sensors using Optimal Transportation Transfer Learning for Mass Production and Long-Term Usage" submitted to Advanced Intelligent Systems. Python file "Soft Sensor Mass Calibration.py" demonstrates how domain adaptation is implemented in the mass calibration situation. Excel file "Mass_total" is a sample data (about 10% of total size) obtained from our experiments.
